# 3360HW3-Q1
This repo is for HW3 in my Computing System Fundamentals (3360) course with
Dr. Mina Guirguis. Fall 2024.

Description: 
(b) If a process starts from the Ready state, what is the probability that it would be in the Running state
in 7 steps/transitions?
(c) If this process has been running for a long time, what is the probability that we would find this process
in the Running state?
(d) If this process has been running for a long time, what is the probability that we would find this process
in the Blocked state?
